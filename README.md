# ColorMe-Discord-Bot

An extremely barebones bot that can color individual users using roles. This is really intended only for small, private servers.

Optionally validates contrast against dark, light, or both themes to prevent hard to read names.

## Instructions

1. Rename `example.env` to `.env` or setup environmental variables and set according to comments
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
